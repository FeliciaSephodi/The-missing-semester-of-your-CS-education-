## Hi reader! ðŸ‘‹



If you're here it's probably because you're interested in what i have to say. On today's post we are talking about a course offered by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.



When I started learning how to code i encountered problems with the tools that were recommended. I'd watch videos but still not grasp anything, that frustrated me a lot. At some point i thought that maybe it was time i gave up, but how dare i give up all because of tool? I took a one week break and decided to watch a few true crime videos on YouTube. It wasn't even halfway through the week when i came across a youtuber talking about the MIT course as well as how it helped her.



And i was glued. Immediately as soon as i finished watching that video i went to Google and looked up the course. There it was, the solution to my dilemmas. I ended my mini break, i had to learn how to use the tools to my advantage and i did. It was a game changer.



The missing semester of your CS education is a course that was created to help CS students with proficiency in the tools that they use.



Why should you take the course?



The course is well structured, the modules that are being taught include topics that I've noticed people struggling with. Bootcamps don't really teach you how to use your tools. Being proficient in the tools that you use on your day to day job makes it easier for you to be productive while enjoying what you're doing.



Modules available



1.Editors



2.Shell tools and scripting



3.Data wrangling



4.Command-line environment



5.Version Control



6.Debbuging and Profiling



7.Metaprogramming



8.Security and Cryptography



9.Potpourri



10.QnA



Conclusion



Video recordings of the lectures are available on YouTube for visual learners and each topic has examples.i hope that this information is useful to you.Â MIT Missing CS Education
